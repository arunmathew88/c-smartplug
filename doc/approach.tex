%This file will contain our design approach
%Describe the basis and then the architecture here - for example how do you calculate medians, what kind of parallelism model is employed? How often do you need to synchronize? etc.
\subsection{Query 1}
For query 1, we have one house process for each house in the data set and a broker process. The broker process reads the data from the input stream and passes it to the corresponding house process. Communication between the processes is done via operating system sockets. House process gets a measurement from the broker and produces a forecast for the next to next time slice.
For each slice size, we need to forecast the load for next to next time slice.
\subsubsection{The Median Algorithm for query 1}
For this query, to forecast the load of a plug in a time slice of a specific size, we need the median of the previous average loads for that time slice and for that slice size. For each day and each plug, we have only one value per day of data for that time slice and slice size. So, we store all these values in a container.

In the median container we maintain two heaps. Out of the two, one is a min-heap and the other is a max-heap. Each heap contains about half of the values. Now following three cases can occur:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: The min-heap contains one more element than the max-heap. In this case, the median is the topmost value of min-heap.
\item Case 2: The max-heap contains one more element than the min-heap. In this case, the median is the topmost value of max-heap.
\item Case 3: Both the min-heap and the max-heap contain equal number of elements. In this case, the median is the average of the topmost value of min-heap and the topmost value of max-heap.

\end{itemize}
