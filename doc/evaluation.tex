%This file will contain the experimental evaluation of the project
\subsection{Datasets used}
We used three datasets to measure the metrics of interest as mentioned in \ref{subsec:metrics}. The three datasets correspond to input from 10 houses, 20 houses and 40 houses. The 10 houses dataset is a subset of 20 houses dataset which in turn is a subset of 40 house dataset.
\subsection{Control Variables}
\subsection{Metrics of Interest}
We considered following metrics as metrics of interest:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Throughput

  Throughput is the number of output events generated per second. For each of the dataset, we measure the throughput for each query. We estimate three values for throughput, the average, 10th percentile and 90th percentile.

  \item Latency

  Latency is the time taken to produce one output event. For each of the dataset, we measure the latency for each query. We estimate three values for latency, the average, 10th percentile and 90th percentile.

  \item Error in Forecast (optional)

  can be squared error between actual value and forecasted value

  \item  For distributed systems (??)

  per query throughput and latency as function of the number of processing nodes

\end{itemize}
