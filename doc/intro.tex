%A little bit of the background of the problem goes here. %Query 1 and 2 are explained briefly.

The ACM DEBS 2014 grand challenge seeks to demonstrate the applicability of event-based systems to provide scalable, real-time analytics over high volume sensor data. The 2014 grand challenge uses the data from smart grid domain and addresses the analysis of energy consumption measurements. The input data comes from the smart plugs installed in households. The analysis involves the forecasting of the future load and the identification of outliers.

In this paper, we present a solution for the following two queries -
In query 1, we have to forecast the total load of each house and average load of each plug at time slices of different intervals.

In query 2, we have to calculate the outliers that are consuming significantly large amount of power than other devices in the occupational unit.In particular, we calculate the percentage of plugs which have a median load during the last window of time greater than the median load of all plugs across all the houses during the same window. We calculate the outliers for two windows of sizes one hour and twenty four hours each.

The paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we detail our design approach and discuss the architecture. In section 3, we present the experimental evaluation and provide the results for query 1 and query 2. We conlude the paper in section 4.
