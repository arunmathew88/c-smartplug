In this paper, we present a simple and elegant solution with very high throughput rate and scalability.

The paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we detail our design approach. Section 3, 4 describes the system architecture and experimental results for Query 1,2 respectively. We present some of the ideas, which we could not implement as part of the current solution, in section 5 as future work. We conclude the paper in section 6.
